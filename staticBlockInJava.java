/*In simpler language whenever we use a static keyword and associate it to a block then that block is referred to as a static block. Unlike C++, Java supports a special block, called a static block (also called static clause) that can be used for static initialization of a class. This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory. 

Calling of static block in java?

Now comes the point of how to call this static block. So in order to call any static block, there is no specified way as static block executes automatically when the class is loaded in memory


Can we print something on the console without creating main() method?

It is very important question from the interviewâ€™s perceptive point. The answer is yes we can print if we are using JDK version 1.6 or previous and if after that  it will throw an. error.
